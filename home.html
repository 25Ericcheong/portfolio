                <li>Reviewers Hub is a website that would allow users to write reviews on anything, users would be able to create their very own account and rate other reviews. This essentially acts as a platform for users to voice their opinions and aggregate their thoughts together as a community</li>
                <li>
                  Users would then be able to save certain reviews into their wishlist, write comments on reviews, upvote or downvote reviews that are bad or good
                </li>
                <li>
                  All reviews, account created by users and reviews that are saved, would be stored in a database. Data is then extracted from the database to be presented visually to users and/or to anyone else visiting the website. The database is also used in multiple other functionalities as well
                </li>
                <li>
                  The website utilizes google chart API to allow users to visualize what they have done - this is specific to how many reviews that they have created on a specific day with the use of a heat map and how the community is growing which is presented with the use of a simple line graph
                </li>
                <li>
                  It also has a simple chatbot that has functionalities like allowing users to delete or ban comments (this is extracted from the database based on user's input on what the comments are about and which product was the comment posted on) or reviews or even find other existing users (by searching for the user's username which is unique in the database)

                <li>This project was open ended as any topic could have been used but it must involved the use of GCP to simulate the use of cloud computing. As such, the topic I chose (based on the availability of data) was focused on predicting user's satisfaction level based on the given dataset</li>
                <li>The project was developed in a way that it allows anyone to be able to replicate and access the project anywhere and anytime as long as permission as granted. The next few bullet points discusses the procedures that I have taken throughout the development of the project and how the project's environment was set up</li>
                <li>Performed analysis on dataset acquired from Kaggle</li>
                <li>Prior to performing model training with dataset, data cleaning was performed to remove duplicates or any other form of anomalies</li>
                <li>Dataset was stored with the use of a distributed file system (Apache Hadoop)</li>
                <li>Processing was achieved with the help of Spark clusters and Spark programming techniques and Spark built-in libraries</li>
                <li>Finally, all results were then visualized with the use of Jupyter Notebook and is deployed with the use of Google Cloud Computing (GCP)</li>

                <li>The robot must be able to segregate three different kinds of balls and will need to be able to start on the fly</li>
                <li>It must also be able to transfer these balls as quickly as possible to the designated locations which makes the weight of the robot an important factor</li>
                <li>The robot was programmed with the use of an Arduino, it was made of plywood mostly, servos were used for any rotational movement, and a push button sensor was used to initialize the robot at the start</li>
                <li>Overall, we managed to placed 13th out of 42 teams in the cohort. This was due to the fact that the robot was able to only successfully deliver some of the balls (at the final designated location - it was only able to deliver half of the number of balls) but it was worth noting that it was able to successfully segregate the different types of balls within the time slot provided to us</li>

                <li>Functionalities includes allowing users to save or load saved game (if a directory does not exist - the system will create one specifically for loading and saving files), visually inspect the amount of time spent while playing the game (time elapsed in game time), keep track of scores or even compare them with other players' scores (locally)</li>
